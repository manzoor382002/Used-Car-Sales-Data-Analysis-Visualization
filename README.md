## Project: Data Analysis of Used Car Sales through Web Scraping  

- Scraped used car listings from online platforms using Python with libraries such as `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to gather real-world data.
- Cleaned and structured the scraped data using MS Excel by handling:
  - Missing values
  - Formatting inconsistencies
  - Irrelevant fields
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in:
  - Car pricing
  - Age and mileage
  - Fuel type and brand popularity
- Built interactive dashboards in **Power BI** to visualize insights, such as:
  - Average resale price by brand
  - Price trends by year and fuel type
- Applied basic statistical techniques like **correlation analysis** to study the impact of variables (e.g., age, kilometers driven) on car prices.
- Delivered data-driven recommendations on pricing strategies and inventory selection to optimize used car sales.

**Tools & Technologies:** Python, BeautifulSoup, requests, MS Excel, Power BI, Statistical Analysis
